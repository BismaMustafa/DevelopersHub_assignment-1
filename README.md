Task 1: Iris Dataset Exploration & Visualization
 Objective

Understand dataset structure and visualize relationships between variables.

 Approach

Loaded dataset using Pandas

Explored structure using .shape, .columns, .head()

Created:

Scatter plots

Histograms

Box plots

Used Matplotlib & Seaborn

Results & Insights

Petal length & width clearly separate species.

Some overlap between Versicolor & Virginica.

Data distribution is balanced and clean.

 Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction
 Objective

Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.

 Approach

Handled missing values

Encoded categorical variables

Trained Logistic Regression model

Evaluated using Accuracy & Confusion Matrix

 Results & Insights

Credit History was the strongest predictor.

Higher income applicants were less likely to default.

Model achieved good predictive performance.

 Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction (Bank Customers)
 Objective

Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank.

 Approach

Removed unnecessary columns

Applied:

One-Hot Encoding (Geography)

Label Encoding (Gender)

Trained Random Forest Classifier

Evaluated using accuracy & confusion matrix

Analyzed feature importance

 Results & Insights

Age and Balance strongly influenced churn.

Active members were less likely to leave.

Feature importance provided valuable business insights.

 Task 4: Insurance Claim Amount Prediction
 Objective

Predict medical insurance charges using regression.

 Approach

Applied One-Hot Encoding

Trained Linear Regression model

Evaluated using:

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

Visualized:

Age vs Charges

BMI vs Charges

Smoker vs Charges

 Results & Insights

Smoking status had the strongest impact on insurance charges.

Charges increased with age.

Model achieved reasonable prediction accuracy.

 Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction
 Objective

Predict which customers are likely to accept a personal loan offer using the Bank Marketing Dataset (UCI Repository).

 Approach

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on:

Age distribution

Job categories

Marital status

Encoded categorical variables

Trained:

Logistic Regression / Decision Tree classifier

Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

 Results & Insights

Customers in certain job categories showed higher acceptance rates.

Married customers had different acceptance behavior compared to single customers.

Middle-aged customers were more likely to accept loan offers.

Model helped identify high-potential customer segments for targeted marketing.
